Hey ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my first documentation site using docasarus.

I have been wanting to try my hands on docasarus,I think there is something about the name though,well I like it. 

I have been cracking my head on what to document using docasarus. I knew docasarus won't be that difficult to pick up for me since I am familiar with React and markdown. 

Even if it was not in React.I would still be able to use it because I enjoy learning and trying new things.

I came across [Chiziaruhoma Ogbonda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiziaruhoma/?originalSubdomain=ng) tweet, he had compiled the APIs used by the INEC irev portal. I decided to document them using docasarus.

The Independent National Electoral Commission commnly called INEC is the body incharge of elections in Nigeria, where I come from. 

We actually just finished our elections. We had the presedential and National Assembly elections in February and gubernatorial elections  elctions in March.

I hope you explore the docs and what it has to offer.
